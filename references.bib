@book{Wickham2016,
abstract = {Second edition. This new edition to the classic book by ggplot2 creator Hadley Wickham highlights compatibility with knitr and RStudio. ggplot2 is a data visualization package for R that helps users create data graphics, including those that are multi-layered, with ease. With ggplot2, it's easy to: ℓ́{\O} produce handsome, publication-quality plots with automatic legends created from the plot specification ℓ́{\O} superimpose multiple layers (points, lines, maps, tiles, box plots) from different data sources with automatically adjusted common scales ℓ́{\O} add customizable smoothers that use powerful modeling capabilities of R, such as loess, linear models, generalized additive models, and robust regression ℓ́{\O} save any ggplot2 plot (or part thereof) for later modification or reuse ℓ́{\O} create custom themes that capture in-house or journal style requirements and that can easily be applied to multiple plots ℓ́{\O} approach a graph from a visual perspective, thinking about how each component of the data is represented on the final plot This book will be useful to everyone who has struggled with displaying data in an informative and attractive way. Some basic knowledge of R is necessary (e.g., importing data into R). ggplot2 is a mini-language specifically tailored for producing graphics, and you'll learn everything you need in the book. After reading this book you'll be able to produce graphics customized precisely for your problems, and you'll find it easy to get graphics out of your head and on to the screen or page. New to this edition:{\textless}ℓ́{\O} Brings the book up-to-date with ggplot2 1.0, including major updates to the theme system ℓ́{\O} New scales, stats and geoms added throughout ℓ́{\O} Additional practice exercises ℓ́{\O} A revised introduction that focuses on ggplot() instead of qplot() ℓ́{\O} Updated chapters on data and modeling using tidyr, dplyr and broom. Introduction -- Getting Started with ggplot2 -- Toolbox -- Mastering the Grammar -- Building a Plot Layer by Layer -- Scales, Axes and Legends -- Positioning -- Themes -- Data Analysis -- Data Transformation -- Modelling for Visualisation -- Programming with ggplot2 -- Index -- R Code Index.},

@book{WDI,
abstract = {World Development Indicators 2016 provides a compilation of relevant, high-quality, and internationally comparable statistics about global development and the fight against poverty. It is intended to help policymakers, students, analysts, professors, program managers, and citizens find and use data related to all aspects of development, including those that help monitor progress toward the World Bank Group's two goals of ending poverty and promoting shared prosperity. Six themes are used to organize indicators—world view, people, environment, economy, states and markets, and global links. WDI 2016 includes: •A selection of the most popular indicators across 214 economies and 14 country groups organized into six WDI themes. •A new section on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has replaced the one on Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). •The SDG section covers all 17 goals, and important targets to achieve these goals. Each goal has been presented in a maximum 2-page spread with selected indicators to explain the targets. •Each of the remaining sections includes an introduction, a map, a table of the most relevant and popular indicators for that theme together with a discussion of indicator compilation methodology. •A user guide describing resources available online and on mobile apps. Download the WDI DataFinder Mobile App and other Data Apps at data.worldbank.org/apps. WDI DataFinder is a mobile app for browsing the current WDI database on smartphones and tablets, using iOS and Android, available in four languages: English, French, Spanish, and Chinese. Use the app to: •Browse data using the structure of the WDI •Visually compare countries and indicators •Create, edit, and save customized tables, charts, and maps •Share what you create on Twitter, Facebook, and via email},
